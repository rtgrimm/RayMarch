# RayMarch

This project is an implementation of the ray marching algorithm, a type of ray tracing. I have chosen to the target platform of this project to be Android because there is very little use of ray marching on mobile platforms. It includes a basic lighting system that employs the Lambertian model for diffuse lighting and the Blinnâ€“Phong model for specular lighting. The unique aspect of this project is its ability to render a list of objects with arbitrary matrix transforms and distance functions. The renderer is not yet optimized, so it will only run on android devices with powerful GPUs. The resources that I have utilized in this project are listed below.
